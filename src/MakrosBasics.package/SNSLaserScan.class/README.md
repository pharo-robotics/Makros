This object has a set of measurements, each measurement is a tuple of angle, range. 

For memory management, the storage of this measurements is an array. Even values are ranges, odds are angles. 

[ angle1, range1, angle2, range2 ... , angleN, rangeN ].

Cartesian ranges are stored in this crappy way as well: 
[ x1,y1, x2,y2, ...., xN, yN  ].
